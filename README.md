# Build a Simple Auction on Blockchain

## Overview
Using Web3.0 you can interact with a Blockchain Contract.

Code in this repository mocks conducting an Auction without the need for a Centralised Authority runnig it (using Ethereum Blockchain).

## Highlevel Steps:
1. Create a Smart Contract that defines how the auction is structured, who the beneficiary is, highest bidder etc etc

2. Compile and Submit the contract to the Blockchain.

3. Take the Bytecode and use it to interact with the Smartcontract from the externalmedium such as a website

## Install

Run ganache-cli
Run testrpc or ganache-cli locally to run the testchain

Use the https://remix.ethereum.org IDE and connect to the localhost for testing the contracts (run -->Environment--> Web 3 Provider).
